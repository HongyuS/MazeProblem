# Maze Problem

 A Swift Playgroud to explore the maze problem.

## Introduction

A maze with a specified size M x N can be generated by using a **two-dimensional array** with the size (M+2) x (N+2), in which 0s are open paths, 1s are barriers, point (1, 1) is the Entrance, and point (M, N) is the Exit. Then, a **stack** is applied to assist the search of a path starting from the Entrance to the Exit.
 
 **Data Input**:
 A maze with size (M+2) x (N+2) in which point (1, 1) is the Entrance and point (M, N) is the Exit.
 
 **Data Output**: (Console)
 Print out the traversal route if there is a path starting from the Entrance point (1, 1) to Exit point (M, N); otherwise, the output is "There is no path to Exit in the maze!".
 
 **Graphical Display**: (GUI)
 
 - *Dark gray* blocks are walls.
 
 - *Green* blocks shows the solution.
 
 - *Orange* blocks shows all positions visited.
 
 Perss "Solve Maze" button to solve the maze. If there exists a solution, the label in the botton-right corner will change to "Solved!"; otherwise, it would remain "No Path Found".
 You can also press "Reset Maze" to generate a new random maze (may not have a solution).
